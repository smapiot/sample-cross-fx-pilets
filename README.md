> Pilets for the Piral Sample - Cross Framework

:zap: Pilets for the [cross framework sample](https://github.com/smapiot/piral/tree/develop/src/samples/sample-cross-fx) of Piral.

## Getting Started

Each directory is an isolated pilet. You can go into each directory, run `npm install` to install all dependencies and then either `npm run build` to build the pilet, or `npm start` to run the debug server.

If you want to see all pilets installing / building correctly then use the *install.sh* script:

```sh
./install.sh
```

## More Information

The demo can be [seen online](https://demo-cross.piral.io/).
